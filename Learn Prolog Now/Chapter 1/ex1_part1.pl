% Exercise 1.1 

% Which of the following sequences of characters are atoms,
% which are variables, and which are neither?

% 3. variable23 - this is an atom
% 4. Variable2000 - this is a variable
% 5. big_kahuna_burger - this is an atom

% 7. big kahuna burger - neither, that is because the empty spaces
% 8. ’Jules’ - atom, because of the single quotes
% 9. _Jules - (anonymous) variable since it starts with an underscore
